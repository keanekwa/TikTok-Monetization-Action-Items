# TikTok Monetization Action Items

In Summer 2022, I managed to secure an internship at TikTok, in the Monetization Product department. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/keane-kwa/

As part of my own initiative, I submitted a set of slides to the company, which was not required as part of the interview process. This was the set of slides submitted, which showcases how I conducted user sentiment analysis, feature prioritization, and cost-impact analysis on the TikTok app (from a Monetization Product point of view).

This set of slides demonstrated my initiative and desire of working for TikTok, and also showcased both my analytical and product management skillsets, eventually allowing myself to secure an internship at TikTok in Summer 2022.
